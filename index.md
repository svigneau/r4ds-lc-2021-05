This learning circle co-organized with [P2PU](https://www.p2pu.org/en/) and [BosLab](https://www.boslab.org/) will use the free [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund  and the community-contributed [R for Data Science Exercise Solutions](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/index.html) book by Jeffrey Arnold. We will cover chapters 5-12 continuing from where we left off in the [first R for Data Science learning circle](https://svigneau.github.io/r4ds-lc-2021-03/). The meetings will consist of an interactive lecture with live coding and small-group exercise breaks.

<br>

#### Prerequisite

To join this learning circle, you should have participated in the [first R for Data Science learning circle](https://svigneau.github.io/r4ds-lc-2021-03/) or be comfortable with the material in chapters 1-5, up to section 5.5, of the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book. If you need help learning or revising these chapters, please email me at sebastien.vigneau[AT]gmail.com.

<br>

#### Sign-up

To join this learning circle, sign-up on the P2PU website is mandatory. The sign-up form is [here](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/signup/online-1645/). Each meeting will build on the previous ones, so participants are asked to attend every meeting or work on their own the sections they may miss.

<br>

#### When

This learning circle meets every Wednesday from 7 pm to 9 pm EST starting May 5th, 2021, for 6 weeks.

<br>

#### Where

We will meet on Zoom. The link will be sent by email after you sign up on the P2PU website.

<br>

#### Course material we will use

[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) teaches how to do data science with R. Chapters cover how to import, tidy, transform, visualize, model, and communicate data. The general philosophy is to teach the most useful skills first, using an abundance of examples and exercises. Solutions to the exercises can be found in a community-contributed [solution book](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/) by Jeffrey Arnold.
